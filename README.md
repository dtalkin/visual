# vis1.py: An implementation of the "Perpetual Diamond" visual motion illusion.

This work was inspired by the
[paper](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2041669518815708)
of Flynn and Shapiro.

## Introduction

The mechanics behind the illusion are clearly explained in the Flynn &
Shapiro paper, which is well worth reading.  The purpose of this
program (vis1.py) is to enable experimentation with all of the dynamic and
static display parameters.

To use this code, simply clone this repository or download vis1.py and
adjuster.py, make vis1.py executable, and run vis1.py.
